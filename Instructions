cd /volume1/@appstore/DVBLinkServer/lib/ #go to where the DVBLink Drivers are kept.
mkdir /volume1/'NAME OF SHARE and where you want to put the drivers'/drivers #a place to put the files we need.
cp -r ko [The folder you made earlier] #move the drivers from the DVBLink directories to your own.
cd [the folder you coppied the drivers to]/ko #go to where the drivers are.
./load_and_start_devices.sh #starts the drivers. At this point, some errors with unused drivers are expected and should not be a concern.
#At this point you can choose to uninstall DVBLink since we no  longer have a use for it!
#Now we know we can manually start the VideoStation drivers with:
cd /var/packages/VideoStation/scripts/
./synodtv.sh start
#and the DVBLink drivers with:
cd /[path to the folder you made earlier]/
./load_and_start_devices.sh
#finally we are going to edit the script that you can use to automatically start the drivers on boot by changing the line that stays [YOUR DIRECTORY HERE] to the location of your directory starting with /.
